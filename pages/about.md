# About

<span style="color: red;"> MSc Social Scientific Data Analysis</span>@LundsUniversiteit 
<span style="color: red;"> BA in Political Science</span>@UniversitatPompeuFabra.

I like to think of what I do as a disciplined exploration of human connections: from the micro to the big stuff. Alongside traditional methods of empirical social research, I use computational social science approaches. 

I am very interested in social media research and user behavior in digital environments, especially when it comes to public opinion and sentiment. I am constantly learning and trying to improve my data skills from end-to-end: from extraction to reporting.  

Art and travel have been the fuel for cultivating different analytical mindsets to interpret data around me. In recent years, I also picked up on birdwatching and putting on trail cams to observe nature. Below, red dots = places I've called home.
