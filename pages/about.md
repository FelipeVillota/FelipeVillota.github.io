# About

<b>MSc in Social Scientific Data Analysis</b><a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/">@LundsUniversiteit</a>                      
<b> BA in Political Science</b><a href="https://www.upf.edu/es/">@UniversitatPompeuFabra</a>

I like to think of what I do as a disciplined exploration of human connections: from the micro to the big stuff. I am very interested in social media research and user behavior in digital environments, especially when it comes to public opinion and sentiment.

Alongside traditional methods of empirical social research, I use computational social science approaches. I am constantly learning and trying to improve my data skills from end-to-end: from extraction to reporting.  

Art and travel have been the fuel for cultivating different analytical mindsets to interpret data around me. In recent years, I also picked up on birdwatching and putting on trail cams to observe nature. Below, red dots = places I've called home.
